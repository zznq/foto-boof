## Description

Foto Boof is a project intended to take your notion of a typical photo booth and turn it on it's head. The plan is to accomplish this by using an XBox Kinect to provide different effect and visualization that people otherwise are familiar with.

This project was originally conceived at Mondo Robot to be apart of [CommuniKey][1] in Boulder, CO.
